# Description

PPO (proximal policy optimization):
Implementing and train a policy to play atari-pong, using only the pixels as input. The project was solved by using convolutional neural nets, multiprocessing, and pytorch to implement and train the policy. 
One notebook was solved with REINFORCE and another with PPO method.
